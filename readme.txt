STORY AND SETTING IDEAS
No story is explained. Only szenarie and randomly appearing npcs give indirekt hints of what happened
they wake up and everything is dark and in background are explosions. Tress are dead.
Living organism have split up into digital/mechanical creatures and treehugging nature freaks who unleashed hell on earth as they destroyed the protective. At the end of time in our solar system certain death is approaching from space
but also from the bottom of the core as the earth core starts to "boil over" unleashing toxic gas through the earth. Players are survivors of a war. Some human, some mashine. 
They need different ressources some of which are only found on the surface most of which are underground. Their base requires the sunlight to run and therewas has to be build on the surface.
